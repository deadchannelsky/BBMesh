# BBMesh - Meshtastic BBS System

ðŸ“‹ **[Release Planning & Roadmap](todo.md)** - Current development status and beta release plan

A bulletin board system (BBS) for Meshtastic mesh networks, inspired by the classic BBS systems of the early computing era. BBMesh provides an interactive, menu-driven interface accessible through Meshtastic radio nodes, bringing the nostalgic experience of dial-up BBSs to modern mesh networking.

## Features

- **Classic BBS Experience**: Hierarchical menu system with configurable options
- **Meshtastic Integration**: Direct serial connection to ESP32-based Meshtastic nodes
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for games, utilities, and custom scripts
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Monitor and respond to multiple Meshtastic channels
- **Configuration-Driven**: All settings managed through YAML configuration files
- **Interactive Sessions**: Stateful conversations with multiple users simultaneously

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi** (or similar Linux system) as the host
- **Heltec ESP32 V3** (or compatible Meshtastic node) connected via USB/Serial
- **LoRa Antenna** appropriate for your region's frequency band

## Quick Start

1. **Install BBMesh**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Generate default configuration**:
   ```bash
   bbmesh init-config
   ```

3. **Edit configuration** to match your setup:
   ```bash
   nano config/bbmesh.yaml
   ```

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   bbmesh start
   ```

## Configuration

BBMesh uses YAML configuration files located in the `config/` directory:

- `bbmesh.yaml`: Main system configuration
- `menus.yaml`: Menu structure and navigation
- `plugins.yaml`: Plugin settings and parameters

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for detailed setup instructions.
