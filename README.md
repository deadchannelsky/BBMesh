# BBMesh
Support original TC2-BBS here:
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/B0B1OZ22Z)

BBMesh is a fork of TC²-BBS integrated with Meshtastic devices. The system allows for message handling, bulletin boards, mail systems, and a channel directory.

### Attribution

This project would not exist without the work of [TC²-BBS](https://github.com/TheCommsChannel/TC2-BBS-mesh). Many thanks to TheCommsChannel for creating and maintaining the original BBS system.

### Docker

If you're a Docker user, BBMesh is available on Docker Hub!

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Meshtastic
- pypubsub

### Update and Install Git
   
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install git
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/deadchannelsky/BBMesh.git
   cd BBMesh
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:  
   
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:  
   
   - On Windows:  
   
   ```sh
   venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```
   
   - On macOS and Linux:
   
   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:  
   
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Rename `example_config.ini`:

   ```sh
   mv example_config.ini config.ini
   ```

6. Set up the configuration in `config.ini`:  

   You'll need to open up the config.ini file in a text editor and make your changes following the instructions below
   
   **[interface]**  
   If using `type = serial` and you have multiple devices connected, you will need to uncomment the `port =` line and enter the port of your device.   
   
   Linux Example:  
   `port = /dev/ttyUSB0`   
   
   Windows Example:  
   `port = COM3`   
   
   If using type = tcp you will need to uncomment the hostname = 192.168.x.x line and put in the IP address of your Meshtastic device.

   **[sync]**
   Enter a list of other BBS nodes you would like to sync messages and bulletins with. Separate each by comma and no spaces as shown in the example below.
   You can find the nodeID in the menu under `Radio Configuration > User` for each node, or use this script for getting nodedb data from a device:  
   
   [Meshtastic-Python-Examples/print-nodedb.py at main · pdxlocations/Meshtastic-Python-Examples (github.com)](https://github.com/pdxlocations/Meshtastic-Python-Examples/blob/main/print-nodedb.py)

   **[settings]**
   `message_delay_ms` controls the pause in milliseconds between split message packets.
   `message_split_len` sets how many characters are sent in each piece of a split message. The default of 60 keeps packets under the radio limit.
   
   Example Config:  
   
   ```ini
   [interface]  
   type = serial  
   # port = /dev/ttyUSB0  
   # hostname = 192.168.x.x  
   
   [sync]
   bbs_nodes = !f53f4abc,!f3abc123

   [settings]
   message_delay_ms = 50
   message_split_len = 60
   ```

### Running the Server

Run the server with:

```sh
python server.py
```

Be sure you've followed the Python virtual environment steps above and activated it before running.

## Command line arguments
```
$ python server.py --help

### Tradewars Server

BBMesh includes a text-based Tradewars game. The game runs as a separate TCP server and is started automatically when a player selects Tradewars from the Games menu.

To use it, install the additional dependencies and optionally start the server manually:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas
python tradewars_server.py
```

The server listens on the port configured in the `[tradewars]` section of `config.ini`. You can also set the path to the Tradewars executable there.




## Automatically run at boot

If you would like to have the script automatically run at boot, follow the steps below:

1. **Edit the service file**
   
   First, edit the mesh-bbs.service file using your preferred text editor. The 3 following lines in that file are what we need to edit:
   
   ```sh
   User=pi
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/BBMesh
   ExecStart=/home/pi/BBMesh/venv/bin/python3 /home/pi/BBMesh/server.py
   ```
   
   The file is currently set up for a user named 'pi' and assumes that the BBMesh directory is located in the home directory (which it should be if the earlier directions were followed)
   
   We just need to replace the 4 parts that have "pi" in those 3 lines with your username.

2. **Configuring systemd**
   
   From the BBMesh directory, run the following commands:
   
   ```sh
   sudo cp mesh-bbs.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```
   
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable mesh-bbs.service
   ```
   
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start mesh-bbs.service
   ```
   
   The service should be started now and should start anytime your device is powered on or rebooted. You can check the status of the service by running the following command:
   
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status mesh-bbs.service
   ```
   
   If you need to stop the service, you can run the following:
   
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl stop mesh-bbs.service
   ```
   
   If you need to restart the service, you can do so with the following command:
   
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart mesh-bbs.service
   ```

2. **Viewing Logs**

   Viewing past logs:
   ```sh
   journalctl -u mesh-bbs.service
   ```

   Viewing live logs:
   ```sh
   journalctl -u mesh-bbs.service -f
   ```

## Radio Configuration

Note: There have been reports of issues with some device roles that may allow the BBS to communicate for a short time, but then the BBS will stop responding to requests. 

The following device roles have been working: 
- **Client**
- **Router_Client**

## Features

- **Mail System**: Send and receive mail messages.
- **Bulletin Boards**: Post and view bulletins on various boards.
- **Channel Directory**: Add and view channels in the directory.
- **Statistics**: View statistics about nodes, hardware, and roles.
- **Wall of Shame**: View devices with low battery levels.
- **Fortune Teller**: Get a random fortune. Pulls from the fortunes.txt file. Feel free to edit this file remove or add more if you like.
- **Tools Menu**: Placeholder for future tools.

## Usage

You interact with the BBS by sending direct messages to the node that's connected to the system running the Python script. Sending any message to it will get a response with the main menu.  
Make selections by sending messages based on the letter or number in brackets - Send M for [M]ail Menu for example.

A video of it in use is available on our YouTube channel:
