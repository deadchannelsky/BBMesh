# BBMesh Beta Release Plan (v0.2.0-beta.1)

## Phase 1: Pre-Release Preparation

### 1.a Code Quality & Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix any failing tests
- [ ] Update documentation for new features

### 1.b Version Management Setup
- [ x] Update pyproject.toml version to 0.2.0-beta.1
- [ x] Create CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- [ x] Set up proper Git branching workflow

### 1.c Release Branch Creation
- [ x] Create `release/0.2.0-beta.1` branch from main
- [ x] Set up GitHub release workflow

## Phase 2: Feature Enhancements for Beta

### Plugin System Improvements
- [ ] Add Bulletin Board System plugin with feature rich functionality
- [ ] Add weather information plugin (if API available)
- [ ] Add simple file storage/sharing plugin images sharing (not possible with curreny meshtastic client, but i can dream)
- [ ] Improve plugin error handling and validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive plugin development documentation

### Core System Enhancements
- [ ] Add configuration validation on startup
- [ ] Improve message handling robustness
- [ ] Add health check endpoints/commands (what in the world do i mean by this?)
- [ ] Optimize performance for resource-constrained devices (eh, do i really want to target lower than pi 4?)
- [ ] Add better error recovery mechanisms

### Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create installation guide for different platforms (Pi, Linux, etc. but need testers)
- [ ] Add mesh tastic hardware compatibility matrix (is this neccesary? Meshtastic is meshtastic?)
- [ ] Provide example configurations for common setups (maybe an auto set up script?)
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide updates

## Phase 3: Release Process

### GitHub Release Creation
- [ ] Tag release as v0.2.0-beta.1
- [ ] Generate release notes from CHANGELOG (what the frack happened to my changelog? Did I delete it?)
- [ ] Create GitHub release with Packaging? Docker? Let someone that wants and knows docker to it?
- [ ] Set up automatic PyPI publishing workflow (eh... not sure when I get tired of the project and am not maintaing should a dead project be in PyPi? Do we need more of those?)

### Post-Release Setup
- [ ] Merge release branch back to main
- [ ] Create `develop` branch for ongoing feature work
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Update project board with next milestone

## Ongoing Development Strategy

### Git Branching Model  (Ok, I'll get here... I promise. When I'm a big boy.)
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for new features
- **feature/**: Individual feature development branches
- **release/**: Release preparation branches
- **hotfix/**: Critical bug fixes for production

### Release Cycle
- [ ] Establish quarterly beta release cycle (hahaha, as if you lazy bastard)
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility until v1.0 (I mean, unless mesh API changes yeah)


### Future Enhancements (Post-Beta)
- [ ] Web interface for configuration (Auto install, then manage from web site, logs from web, hngggg.)
- [ ] Mobile app integration (so, not to try to suplant the meshtastic app, but uh... is this possible?)
- [ ] Advanced BBS routing features, e.g. Mirror relevant things to other BBS nodes. (Bulletins, news, other?)
- [ ] Mesh network analytics (I am not sure what I even mean by this. )
- [ ] Plugin marketplace/repository (hahaha, yes MONETIZE EVERY THING, no seriously a plugin repo or marketplace type install, e.g. I want the Bulletin system, the JS8Call plugin so I select then install/integrate from repository)

## Questions for Community Input
1. What plugins would be most valuable for the mesh community?
2. Which hardware platforms should we prioritize for testing? (I mean, Heltec, LilGo, they all are API compliant... so I dunno)
3. What configuration options are most needed? (See, here is my blind spot)
4. How can we improve the user onboarding experience? (I feel like I can install it because it grew up with me and my adderal and coffee.... is it impossible to install/configure)

## Target Beta Features Summary
- Enhanced plugin architecture with 3+ new built-in plugins
- Improved error handling and system stability
- Better documentation ( I mean probably AI can take a review crack at it.)
- Other people in a Foundation for ongoing feature development(oh yeah, thats my arrogance showing up.)

## Review Section

### Systemctl Service Deployment Implementation (2025-08-01)

#### Summary of Changes Made
Successfully implemented comprehensive systemctl service deployment capabilities for BBMesh:

**1. Core Infrastructure:**
- Created `scripts/install-service.sh` - Automated installation script with security hardening
- Added CLI service management commands (`install-service`, `uninstall-service`, `service-status`, `health-check`)
- Implemented configuration validation for service deployment paths
- Added service management utility (`scripts/manage-service.sh` → `bbmesh-service` command)

**2. Key Features Added:**
- **Automated Installation**: Complete systemd service setup with one command
- **Security Hardening**: Dedicated user, restricted permissions, resource limits
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health check functionality
- **Backup System**: Automated daily backups with retention policies
- **Log Management**: Proper log rotation and centralized logging
- **Easy Management**: Simple commands for service control

**3. Service Capabilities:**
- Runs as dedicated `bbmesh` user with minimal privileges
- Automatic start on boot with proper dependency handling
- Resource limits (512MB RAM, 50% CPU quota)
- Secure file system access with read-only protection
- Automated maintenance via cron jobs
- Complete uninstall capability with data preservation option

**4. User Experience Improvements:**
- Single command installation: `sudo ./scripts/install-service.sh`
- Easy service management: `bbmesh-service start|stop|status|logs|health`
- CLI integration: `bbmesh install-service`, `bbmesh service-status`
- Comprehensive documentation in `scripts/README.md`

#### Technical Implementation Details
- **Configuration Validation**: Added `validate_service_deployment()` and `create_service_config()` methods to Config class
- **Security Features**: systemd service hardening with NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp, ProtectSystem
- **Monitoring**: Health checks validate config, serial port access, disk space, and dependencies
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated tar.gz backups with 30-day retention
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user-friendly error messages

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Installation script structure complete
- ✅ CLI commands implemented and functional
- ✅ Configuration validation working
- ✅ Service management utility ready
- ⚠️ **Requires testing on actual Linux system with systemd**

#### Files Modified/Created
- `scripts/install-service.sh` - New automated installation script
- `scripts/manage-service.sh` - New service management utility  
- `scripts/README.md` - New comprehensive documentation
- `src/bbmesh/cli.py` - Added service management commands
- `src/bbmesh/core/config.py` - Added service deployment validation

#### Remaining Work
- [ ] Test installation on real Linux system
- [ ] Validate systemd service operation
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Verify serial port permissions work correctly
- [ ] Document any platform-specific requirements

### Previous Tasks
- [x] Initial release planning and roadmap creation

### Next Review Date
Target: After successful testing of service deployment on Linux system
